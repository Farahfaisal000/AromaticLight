# Aromatic Light – Automated Candle Making Machine 🕯️

##  Project Overview
**Aromatic Light** is an automated candle-making machine designed to simplify and speed up the traditional candle production process.  
The system allows users to create customized scented candles by selecting the wax type, colors, fragrances, and number of molds through a user-friendly mobile application.

This project is intended for **individual users and small-scale businesses**, providing an efficient, safe, and customizable solution for handmade candle production.

---

##  Objectives
- Automate the candle-making process to reduce manual effort.
- Improve safety by minimizing direct contact with hot wax.
- Enable customization of candle color, scent, and quantity.
- Ensure consistency and quality in every produced candle.
- Support home-based and small-scale candle businesses.

##  System Features
- Selection of **wax type** (Soy or Paraffin).
- Choice of **up to 3 molds** per production cycle.
- **Color customization** (single color or mixed ratios).
- **Fragrance selection** with adjustable intensity.
- Automated **heating, mixing, pouring, and cooling** stages.
- Integrated **ventilation system** for faster solidification.
- Remote control via a **mobile application**.
- Real-time monitoring using LCD and sensors.
